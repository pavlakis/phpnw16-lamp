# PHP 7 LAMP Stack 

An Ubuntu 16.04 LAMP stack with PHP 7 for the PHPNW16 tutorial day

**Note** It uses ansible but it is loaded through the VM so it is Windows-friendly.

Added required dependencies for:

* [Building Modern APIs in PHP](http://conference.phpnw.org.uk/phpnw16/speakers/rob-allen/#tutorial)
* [Modelling by Example](http://conference.phpnw.org.uk/phpnw16/speakers/ciaran-mcnulty/#tutorial)
